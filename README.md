### known problems:
<p>evaluate_position() is completely useless and will only return 0</p>
<p>has_won() had some problems with specific 
known move case so that was just commented out to be addressed later</p>

### TO DO: 
<p>read in board from txt </p>
<p>write next move to txt</p>
<p>make into iterative deepening search instead of static depth of 30</p>
